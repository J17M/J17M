## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Juan

I am a sophomore at UW-Madison, majoring in computer science & data science. I have an interest in exploring all aspects of cybersecurity and am passionate about learning and growing, specifically ethical hacking and cryptography 

In addition to my studies, I enjoy participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, developing cryptographic scripts, and staying up-to-date with the latest tech. I aim to share writeups and projects to reflect my journey in this field.
